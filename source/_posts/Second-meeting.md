By this point the aforementioned list of wishes and desired features. Has shortened significantly. The group seems to have settled for for a story-driven rogue-like where death changes the game to some other game. They want this game's setting to be a tower rather than a dungeon and for the game to be either modern or post apocalyptic in setting rather than traditional video-game fantasy.

I do not feel this bodes well for the future of our project. Do not misunderstand me, it is not a matter of personal taste.  As a matter of fact this particular list of features would appeal to me if it were a description of someone else's games. However, that is what they are: a loose description, and not an action plan. Having a list of constraints rather than a concrete plan of what needs to be done is more likely to hinder progress that to clarify what needs to be done.

But there is one constraint that I find particularly troubling: switching to a different game on death. If creating a single game is more than enough work for a month, this decision basically duplicates our workload.

Besides the unfortunate decision that the group has taken there is something else that also bothers me: the impression that rather than rejecting my idea what they were rejecting was me as a person. I do not seem to be particularly liked by anyone yet and my attempts at small talk have failed so far.
