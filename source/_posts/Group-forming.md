Today was our first lecture in _Video Game Design_(DH2650). During this lecture, the project groups were assigned. Our group consists of the following participants:

+ Adam, Jonathan
+ Ates, Nilay
+ Hemgre, Dan
+ Lingtorp, Alexander
+ Van der Heide, Ewoud
+ _And I,_ Roa Rodr√≠guez, Rodrigo

We booked a meeting for tomorrow to present our game ideas. In preparation for this meeting I prepared a fully fleshed game pitch and created a Keynote presentation describing the mechanics:

</a>

I have also created some concept art showing how some of the tiles could look. This is in order to further consolidate the game's aesthetic of direction as well as to get people exited for the game.
