Today was the first meeting and it was a disaster. Not only did my idea get rejected but what the group opted instead is not a concrete game but a long list of wishes and desired features.

What they want to make is a story-driven rogue-like where death changes the game to some other game. They want this game's setting to be a tower rather than a dungeon and for the game to be either modern or post apocalyptic in setting rather than traditional video-game fantasy.

I do not feel this bodes well for the future of our project. Do not misunderstand me, it is not a matter of personal taste.  As a matter of fact this particular list of features would appeal to me if it were a description of someone else's games. However, that is what they are: a loose description, and not an action plan. Having a list of constraints rather than a concrete plan of what needs to be done is more likely to hinder progress that to clarify what needs to be done.

But there is one constraint that I find particularly troubling: switching to a different game on death. If creating a single game is more than enough work for a month, this decision basically duplicates our workload.

Besides the unfortunate decision that the group has taken there is something else that also bothers me: the impression that rather than rejecting my idea what they were rejecting was me as a person. I do not seem to be particularly liked by anyone yet and my attempts at small talk have failed so far.  

I felt this way because I did not seem able to make an statement or express a desire without somebody jumping to make an argument against it or insisting on an alternative. In the end it is not a coincidence that the proposal reads as a list of loose unrelated wishes. After all it was an amalgam of everyones desires except mine.

Additionally, I suggested that we should try to assign group roles today. As expected my suggestion was rejected.

My chances at becoming the group leader seem slim, but I must to try nonetheless, because there are two critical issues that need to be addressed. First that our scope is too large for the amount of time that we have, and second that our current proposal is not clear enough for autonomous work. If whoever becomes the leader does not realize this we will have serious issues delivering a project on time.
