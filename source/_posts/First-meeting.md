Today was the first meeting and it was a disaster. Not only did my idea get rejected but what the group opted instead is not a concrete game but a long list of wishes and desired features.

- Rodrigo
  * Mobile game with a simple mechanic
  * Examples:
    - Candy Crush
    - Pok√©mon Go
    - Angry birds

- Ewoud
  * Artistic game, the mechanic is not important could be a point and click.
  * Examples:
    - The Average Everyday Adventures of Samantha Browne
    - Depression quest
    - That dragon cancer

- Jonathan Adam
  1. AR where there are two teams must beacon different parts of the city.
    * Examples:
      - Ingress
  2. You have to do something but you are not allowed to look. Based on the myth of Orpheus.
    * Example:
      - Slenderman game

- Alexander Lingtorp
  1. Dying switches game world. Progress in one world would impact the other. Different gameplay in each world.
  2. Play God. Where you rule over a city.

- Dan Hemgren
  1. Supersmash game (sideview fighter) in VR.
  2. Dungeon crawler where you go up rather than down. With a very high skyscraper. The game is very difficult and

- Nilay Ates
  - A city building game like sim-city. A low poly aesthetic, futuristic setting.
    * Example:
      - The long dark, Polyworld, tale of two Brothers aesthetic.
      - Sim-city gameplay.


Additionally, I suggested that we should try to assign group roles today. However we did not get very far, because all other group members were in a hurry to leave.

My chances at becoming the group leader seem slim, but I must to try nonetheless, because there are two critical issues that need to be addressed. First that our scope is too large for the amount of time that we have, and second that our current proposal is not clear enough for autonomous work. If  Jonathan becomes the leader I do hope he realizes this, because otherwise we will have serious issues delivering a project on time.

**EDIT**: Someone just made a vote for the role in the group Slack. Since the vote was openly visible there was full bandwagon effect and I was the one last to vote. Since there were no ties in the first place my vote was meaningless regardless of what I did. Jonathan is the new group leader.
